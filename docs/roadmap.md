## 🔜 Up Next

### Part 2.5: Satellite System
*Distributed speakers and microphones in every room.*

> **Design doc:** [satellite-system.md](satellite-system.md)

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Satellite Agent** | Lightweight daemon for ESP32-S3, Raspberry Pi, or any Linux device |
| **Audio Streaming** | Continuous wake-word detection → stream audio to central server |
| **Speaker Output** | Receive TTS audio from server, play through local speaker |
| **Registration** | Auto-discover and register with Atlas Cortex server |
| **Room Assignment** | Admin assigns satellite to room/area for spatial awareness |
| **Hardware Agnostic** | Core protocol works on any device with mic + speaker + network |

**Supported Hardware:**
- ESP32-S3 (INMP441 mic + MAX98357A speaker) — $15 per room
- Raspberry Pi Zero 2W with USB mic + speaker — $25 per room
- Raspberry Pi 3/4/5 with ReSpeaker HAT — $50+ per room
- Any Linux box with ALSA audio — repurpose old hardware

**Key Design Goals:**
- Satellite is a thin client — all processing happens on the server
- Wyoming protocol for STT/TTS communication
- Wake word detection runs locally (openWakeWord) to minimize network traffic
- Graceful degradation: if server is unreachable, satellite announces "Atlas is offline"

#### MVP Blockers (must complete before release)

| Item | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| **Wake Word Reliability** | Cold-start detection needs 2-3 tries on ReSpeaker 2-mic (scores 0.26-0.38 vs threshold 0.25). Investigate model fine-tuning, mic AGC, or alternative engine. | 🔴 Pending |
| **Button Config in Admin UI** | Add button_mode dropdown (toggle/press/hold) to satellite detail view. Backend API field exists. | 🟡 Pending |

#### Conversational Engine (pre-MVP)

Transform the voice pipeline from a rigid state machine (wake → listen → process → speak → idle) into a continuous, natural conversational flow.

| Phase | Feature | Description | Depends On |
|-------|---------|-------------|------------|
| CE-1 | **Streaming STT + Extended Listening** | Keep mic active longer after wake word. Run local phrase/sentence boundary detection (not LLM) to segment speech in real-time. Only send complete phrases to pipeline. Don't cut off slow speakers. | — |
| CE-2 | **Multi-Question Queuing** | Queue multiple detected phrases and process in order. If user asks 3 questions before first answer, queue all 3. Filler may be unnecessary if TTS finishes before user stops talking. | CE-1 |
| CE-3 | **Barge-In / Interruption** | Keep mics hot during TTS playback. Detect "stop", "nevermind", or user speaking over Atlas. Kill current TTS stream immediately. Natural conversation: if someone talks over you, you stop. | — |
| CE-4 | **Conversational Pause & Pivot** | When user interrupts Atlas mid-speech, pause TTS (don't kill). Listen to what they say. If it's a correction or new question, pivot to new response. If it's just "uh huh", resume after a few seconds. | CE-3 |
| CE-5 | **Adaptive Dual-State LEDs** | Outer LEDs show listening state, inner LEDs show activity/processing state. Auto-configure layout by satellite hardware (ReSpeaker 2-mic has 3 LEDs, 4-mic has 12, etc). Satellite reports LED count in capabilities. | — |

**Architecture notes:**
- CE-1 and CE-3 are independent — can be built in parallel
- CE-2 builds on CE-1's phrase detection; CE-4 builds on CE-3's barge-in detection
- CE-5 (LEDs) is independent and can ship with any phase
- Filler cache (18 pre-generated phrases, already implemented) becomes less important as CE-1/CE-2 reduce dead time

### Part 2.7: Fast-Path Plugins
*Layer 2 plugins that bypass the LLM for common queries — instant responses, lower latency, reduced GPU load.*

These plugins intercept frequent request types at Layer 2, hitting external APIs or local logic directly instead of routing through the LLM. Each one follows the existing `CortexPlugin` interface (`match` → `handle`). The nightly evolution job already identifies LLM fallthrough patterns that could become fast-path plugins, but these are proactively built for the most common cases.

**All plugins are opt-in.** Users enable what they want from the Admin Panel → Plugins page. Disabled plugins are never loaded — queries fall through to the LLM as normal.

```

**Per-plugin settings (⚙):**
- API key / URL / credentials
- Response preferences (units: °F/°C, currency: USD/EUR, language)
- Custom regex patterns (power users can add their own trigger phrases)
- Priority (higher priority plugins match first)
- Cache TTL (how long to cache API responses — e.g., weather: 30 min)
- Fallback behavior: if API is down, fall through to LLM or return error

**Plugin stats dashboard:**
- Hit count per plugin (last 24h, 7d, 30d)
- Average response time per plugin
- LLM bypass rate (% of queries handled without LLM)
- Suggested new plugins from evolution job analysis
- Most common LLM fallthrough queries (candidates for new fast-path rules)

**Architecture per plugin:**
```python
class WeatherPlugin(CortexPlugin):
    plugin_id = "weather"
    plugin_type = "query"

    async def match(self, message, context) -> CommandMatch:
        # Regex patterns: "weather", "temperature", "rain", "forecast", etc.
        # Return confidence score based on match quality

    async def handle(self, message, match, context) -> CommandResult:
        # 1. Extract location (from message, user profile, or HA zone)
        # 2. Hit weather API directly
        # 3. Format natural-language response from template
        # 4. Return — never touches LLM
```

**Key design points:**
- Each plugin is opt-in — disabled plugins are never loaded
- Plugins with no API key requirement work out of the box (math, jokes, timers, etc.)
- API keys configured per-plugin in admin settings
- Response templates are natural language, not robotic ("It's 72°F and sunny in Austin — perfect day to be outside")
- Plugins can optionally enrich LLM context (e.g., weather data included when LLM handles a complex weather question)
- Evolution job tracks which queries still fall through to LLM and suggests new patterns or new plugins
- Users can write custom plugins following the `CortexPlugin` interface and drop them in

> **Implementation note:** Timers/Alarms and Calendar overlap with Part 3. The fast-path plugin handles the voice interface; Part 3 adds the full scheduler, recurrence, and multi-room delivery.

---

> **Design doc:** [alarms-timers-reminders.md](alarms-timers-reminders.md)

| Feature | Example |
|---------|---------|
| **Alarms** | *"Wake me up at 7am"* — plays on bedroom satellite or HA media player |
| **Timers** | *"Set a 15-minute timer"* — cooking timers with voice countdown |
| **Reminders** | *"Remind me to take medicine at 3pm"* — recurring with snooze |
| **Location triggers** | *"Remind me when I get home to check the mail"* — presence-based |
| **Multi-user** | Each family member has their own alarms, announced in their room |

**Architecture:**
- Timer/alarm scheduler runs as background asyncio task
- Alarms stored in SQLite with recurrence rules (RRULE format)
- Delivery via satellite speakers (nearest to user) or HA media players
- Snooze/dismiss via voice: *"Snooze for 5 minutes"* / *"Stop"*

---

### Part 4: Routines & Automations

> **Design doc:** [routines-automations.md](routines-automations.md)

| Feature | Example |
|---------|---------|
| **Built-in routines** | *"Good morning"* → lights, coffee, weather, calendar |
| **Bedtime** | *"Good night"* → locks, lights off, alarm set, sleep sounds |
| **Departure** | *"I'm leaving"* → security arm, thermostat eco, non-essentials off |
| **Custom routines** | *"When I say 'movie time', dim lights to 20% and turn on TV"* |
| **Conditional** | *"If temperature drops below 60, turn on the heater"* |

**Architecture:**
- Routines are stored as ordered action sequences in SQLite
- Each action maps to an HA service call, Atlas command, or delay
- Conversational builder: Atlas asks clarifying questions to build routines
- Trigger types: voice command, schedule, sensor threshold, presence change

---

### Part 5: Proactive Intelligence

> **Design doc:** [proactive-intelligence.md](proactive-intelligence.md)

| Feature | Example |
|---------|---------|
| **Weather awareness** | *"It's going to rain — should I close the garage?"* |
| **Energy optimization** | *"AC has been on 8 hours — house is at 68°F"* |
| **Anomaly detection** | *"Basement humidity is unusually high"* |
| **Package tracking** | *"Your Amazon order arrives tomorrow 2-6pm"* |
| **Activity patterns** | *"You usually start the coffee maker by now — want me to?"* |

---

### Part 6: Learning & Education

> **Design doc:** [learning-education.md](learning-education.md)

| Feature | Example |
|---------|---------|
| **Homework help** | Age-appropriate explanations, never gives direct answers |
| **Interactive quizzes** | *"Quiz me on state capitals"* with score tracking |
| **Science mode** | *"What happens if we mix baking soda and vinegar?"* |
| **Language learning** | Vocabulary drills, pronunciation practice, flashcards |
| **Reading companion** | Read-along mode for young children |

---

### Part 7: Intercom & Broadcasting

> **Design doc:** [intercom-broadcasting.md](intercom-broadcasting.md)

| Feature | Example |
|---------|---------|
| **Targeted broadcast** | *"Tell the kids dinner is ready"* → children's rooms |
| **Whole-house** | *"Announce: family meeting in 5 minutes"* → all satellites |
| **Room-to-room** | *"Atlas, talk to the garage"* → opens intercom channel |
| **Emergency alert** | Smoke/CO detection → all speakers: *"Fire alarm triggered"* |

---

### Part 8: Media & Entertainment

> **Design doc:** [media-entertainment.md](media-entertainment.md)

| Feature | Example |
|---------|---------|
| **Music playback** | *"Play jazz in the living room"* |
| **Multi-room audio** | Synchronized playback across satellites |
| **Audio recognition** | *"What song is this?"* |
| **Recommendations** | *"Recommend a movie for family night"* |
| **Podcast/audiobook** | *"Resume my audiobook in the kitchen"* |

**Music Sources (priority order):**
